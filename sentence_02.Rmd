This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 


```{r}
# Turn off scientific notation

# Load the tidyverse.

```

## Load and Cleaning Data

In this section, describe the source of the data, write a basic data dictionary for data you are working with, and discuss any caveats or issues you discovered working with this data. 

```{r}
dc_wikia_data <- read_csv("dc-wikia-data.csv")
marvel_wikia_data <- read_csv("marvel-wikia-data.csv")
```

## Sentences to Engineer
In this notebook, we are reverse engineering five sentences from the story.

### Sentence 2

* **Sentence text**: In both DC and Marvel, women were of neutral allegiance at a higher rate than men.
DC: Female: Good 54%, Neutral 12%, Bad 34%. Male: Good 42%, Neutral 8%, Bad 50%. 
Marvel: Female: Good 48%, Neutral 21%, Bad 31%. Male: Good 30%, Neutral 15%, Bad 55%.

* **Analysis summary**: I was able to verify that women were of neutral allegiance at a higher rate than men in both DC (10% neutral women to 8% neutral men) and Marvel (17% to 12%). I also was curious about the other percentages, so I calculated those as well. Below are my findings compared to the numbers from the reported story. The only issue is that I was not able to fully reproduce the exact data. I had 10 to 8 in DC (the story had 12 to 8), and I had 17 to 12 Marvel (the story had 21 to 15)

Reported Story:
DC: Female: Good 54%, Neutral 12%, Bad 34%. Male: Good 42%, Neutral 8%, Bad 50%. 
Marvel: Female: Good 48%, Neutral 21%, Bad 31%. Male: Good 30%, Neutral 15%, Bad 55%.

My code results:
DC: Female: Good 48%, Neutral 10%, Bad 30%. Male: Good 39%, Neutral 8%, Bad 47%. 
Marvel: Female: Good 40%, Neutral 17%, Bad 25%. Male: Good 26%, Neutral 12%, Bad 46%.
