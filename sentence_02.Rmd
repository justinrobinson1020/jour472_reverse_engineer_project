This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 


```{r}
# Turn off scientific notation
options(scipen=999)

# Load the tidyverse.
library(tidyverse)
```

## Load and Cleaning Data

In this section, describe the source of the data, write a basic data dictionary for data you are working with, and discuss any caveats or issues you discovered working with this data. 

```{r}
dc_wikia_data <- read_csv("dc-wikia-data.csv")
marvel_wikia_data <- read_csv("marvel-wikia-data.csv")
```

## Sentences to Engineer
In this notebook, we are reverse engineering five sentences from the story.

### Sentence 2

* **Sentence text**: â€œIn both DC and Marvel, women were of neutral allegiance at a higher rate than men. DC: Female: Good 54%, Neutral 12%, Bad 34%. Male: Good 42%, Neutral 8%, Bad 50%. Marvel: Female: Good 48%, Neutral 21%, Bad 31%. Male: Good 30%, Neutral 15%, Bad 55%

* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

#This code tells us that there are 1967 female characters in the dc_wikia_data set.
dc_all_female <- dc_wikia_data %>%
  filter(SEX == "Female Characters") %>%
  summarise(count=n())

#This code tells us that there are 953 "Good Female Characters" in the dc_wikia_data set.
dc_good_female <- dc_wikia_data %>%
  filter(SEX == "Female Characters") %>% 
  filter(ALIGN == "Good Characters") %>%
  summarise(count=n())
